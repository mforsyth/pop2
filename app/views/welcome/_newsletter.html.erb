<h1>Philadelphia's Largest Orchard!</h1>

<p>POP and its partners <%= link_to "Bartram's Garden",  'http://www.bartramsgarden.org/' %> 
and the <%= link_to 'Urban Nutrition Initiative (UNI)', 'http://www.urbannutrition.org/' %>
  received a generous grant from the ACTrees People's
  Garden program to expand the Bartram's Orchard. Volunteers helped
  plant an additional 44 fruit trees there this spring, making it the
  largest orchard in the city!  When completed this fall, the orchard
  will total well over 100 fruit and nut trees and will demonstrate
  the breadth and width of what can be grown in Philadelphia. In the
  spirit of John Bartram's history as a plant collector, the orchard
  will include everything from heirloom varieties of apples, pears,
  and cherries to more unusual fruits like paw paws, jujubes, and
  medlars.  Volunteers also assisted in creating a wetland garden
  featuring blueberries, chokeberries, elderberries, and perennials
  designed to attract beneficial insects and pollinators to the
  orchard.   This exciting educational orchard space is part of the
  newly developed Community Farm, a larger partnership between
  Bartram's Garden, UNI, PHS, and Parks & Rec.  Ultimately the orchard
  will supplement the vegetables and other produce already being grown
  and sold by UNI's high school farmers in the underserved communities
  of Southwest Philadelphia.</p>

<p>
Use of the Bartram's Orchard as an urban orchard educational hub also
began this spring.  More than sixty Philadelphia orchard enthusiasts
gathered at Bartram's Garden on March 10th to participate in a
Holistic Orchard Training event organized by POP, Bartram's Garden,
and UNI.  The all day intensive workshop was led by orchard all-star
Michael Phillips, a leader of the community orchard movement and
author of The Apple Grower and The Holistic Orchard.  Participants
spent the morning in the classroom learning the basics of holistic
orchard care, including companion plants to build orchard ecology, use
of compost tea and other organic foliar sprays, and natural pest &
disease management.  In the afternoon, participants gained hands-on
experience in pruning techniques demonstrated at the Bartram's Orchard
and nearby POP orchards at Earth's Keepers Farm and the Chester Ave
Community Garden.  The training was open to the public, but POP also
sponsored scholarships for orchard caretakers from its partner sites
across the city to attend.   </p>

<h1>Spring 2012 Event Summary</h1>

<p>
<b>Hunting Park Orchard</b>,  North Philadelphia.  Grapes, kiwis, and a wide

Rec, and POP. Produce will be distributed within the neighborhood by
the community gardeners.
<br>
<b>Teens 4 Good Orchard @ Carousel House</b>, West Fairmount Park.  Newly

<h1>Orchard Report: Fairhill</h1>

<p>The Fairhill neighborhood around 9th & Indiana Streets in North Philly has plenty of new life in the form of edible greenery & community, thanks largely to its partnership with POP! Throughout the season, neighbors of various ages have been planting, harvesting, & spending much more time in the Historic Fair Hill Burial Ground Orchard (900 block of W Indiana St), Evelyn Sanders Orchard (3000 block of N Percy St), & 9th & Indiana Corner Gardens. </p>

<p>In March, Fair Hill Burial Ground had a workparty with <a href="http://phillyfoodforests.org/">Philly Food Forests</a> to remove all of its raised beds & redesign its garden for greater food production, better aesthetics, & expanded edible perennial plantings. The raised beds from Fair Hill were reconstructed in the nearby Evelyn Sanders Orchard, where there are now 8 beds exploding with vegetables in addition to the prolific perennial edibles lining the lot's fences & a sturdy new bench where residents relax. The workparty was followed in April by a great POP volunteer day where 12 varieties of berries, 2 rose bushes, & 4 varieties of fruit trees were planted throughout the burial ground's garden space. The corner of 9th & Indiana Streets has had a beautiful makeover due to new neighbor involvement, benches, new fruit trees, & colorful perennial flowers. </p>

<%= image_with_caption '47', 'Community gathering at the revitalized Peaches Garden at 9th & Indiana.' %>

<p>The sites have come alive this summer with community meetings, first fruit harvests, summer camp visits, art projects, produce giveaways, & July 14th's annual Fair Hill Summer Festival, proven to be the best attended yet! If you would like to visit the area & learn about its bounty, feel free to stop by any Monday, Thursday, or Saturday between 4-6pm when POP's Orchard Liaison for the sites, Robyn Mello, has the Fair Hill gates opened. She'd be more than happy to give you a tour & a tasting!</p>
