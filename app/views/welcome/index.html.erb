<h3>Welcome to our website!</h3>

<p>
  <strong>Mission:</strong> The Philadelphia Orchard Project plants and supports community orchards in the city of Philadelphia.
</p>

<p>
POP works with community-based groups and volunteers to plan and plant orchards filled with useful and edible plants. POP provides the plants, trees, and training. Community organizations own, maintain, and harvest the orchards, expanding community-based food production. Orchards are planted in formerly vacant lots, community gardens, schoolyards, and other spaces, almost exclusively in low-wealth neighborhoods where people lack access to fresh fruit.
</p>

<p>Please join POP in building community food security for Philadelphiaâ€™s future!</p>
