<h3>Welcome to our website!</h3>

<p>
  <strong>Mission:</strong> The Philadelphia Orchard Project plants and supports community orchards in the city of Philadelphia.
</p>

<p>
POP works with community-based groups and volunteers to plan and plant orchards filled with useful and edible plants. POP provides the plants, trees, and training. Community organizations own, maintain, and harvest the orchards, expanding community-based food production. Orchards are planted in formerly vacant lots, community gardens, schoolyards, and other spaces, almost exclusively in low-wealth neighborhoods where people lack access to fresh fruit.
</p>

<p>Please join POP in building community food security for Philadelphiaâ€™s future!</p>

    <li> Planted 6 new orchards with our community partners and
      volunteers and expanded many existing sites.  </li>

      2112 perennials to city orchards. </li>
    <li> Celebrated our 3rd annual Philadelphia Orchard Day with over
      1250 participants at harvest festivals and other events at 13
      orchard sites across the city.</li>
    <li> Conducted our first ever POP orchard survey, revealing that
      3000 Philadelphians tasted something grown in our orchards this
      year, 3000 participated in orchard care, 5000 used them as
      gathering spaces, and 6000 participated in educational
      programs.   </li>
    <li> Received new grants from ACTrees, Junior League Blossom Fund,
      Claneil, Patricia Kind, and Rosenlund foundations.
