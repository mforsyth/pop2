<h3>PLANT with POP!
</h3>

<p>POP plants orchards in the spring and fall. Everyone is welcome to participate!
More hands make less work, so volunteers are especially appreciated. Planting orchards is fun for almost all ages, and typically includes weeding, mulching, planting, and eating – and of course getting a bit dirty. It’s a great way to make a difference in a Philadelphia neighborhood!
